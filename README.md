  Cyber Security Home Lab Andy Nguyen

 I will be creating a homelab environment meant to simulate the components of an I.T. infrastruce, equipment, and configurations similar to a business or enterprise network. 

My goal of this project is to understand the process of installing, configuring, and optimizing I.T. infrastrucuter at a relatively small scale so I can apply this process to a real-world business or enterprise network.
